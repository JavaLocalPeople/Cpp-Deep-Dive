	STL: Algorithms

	The header <algorithm> defines a collection of functions especially designed to be used on ranges of elements. 

	A range is any sequence of objects that can be accessed through iterators or pointers, such as an array or an 
	instance of some of the STL containres. Notice though, that algorithms operate through iterators directly
	on the values, not affecting in any way the structure of any possible container (it never affects the size or
	storage allocation of the container)
	
	Categories:

	1.Non-modifying sequence operations
	2.Modifying sequence operations
	3.Partitions
	4.Sorting
	5.Binary Search
	6.Merge
	7.Heap
	8.Min/max
	9.Other
